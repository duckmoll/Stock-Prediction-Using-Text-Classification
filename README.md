# Stock-Prediction-Using-SEC-NLP

# Project Proposal

For the final project, I will use the SEC Filings, excluding 10-K, 10-Q and Form 4 to predict the stock prices. Applying NLP techniques to predict stock price has always been an interesting topic. From the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the market moves by ingesting new information. Official announcements like: merger and acquisition, major shareholder changes, dispose of company stocks, etc should have an impact on the company's stock price. Because 10-K and 10-Q contain more complicated information than the other fillings, I will exclude these two types of fillings in this project. The input will be the text of SEC filings from a selected group of companies. And target output will be that companyâ€™s next day return(+/-).


For data, I will collect the texts from the sec filings website. Because of the simple setup, I can apply and experiment with a variety of models. I will use BOW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec to vectorize our data and predict the target using machine learning models like random forest or lightgbm.After implementing above baseline models, I will try to implement deep learning techniques like RNN and BERT to make more sophisticated predictions.
Since this is a binary classification problem, precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score will be used to measure the model performance. For machine learning approaches, the local environment should suffice. For deep learning models, I may use cloud platforms like GCP or AWS to run our models.


The biggest unknowns are the data pre-processing, implementation of deep learning models, and how to train numerical data in text. As I have not used the dataset before, it may take some time for us to extract and clean the data. And since I only have limited experience with deep learning frameworks, u will spend some time deciding which is the most suitable. I am currently considering using keras. And because the numbers in financial files can contain meaningful information to the market, I need to research for a method to handle numerical values in text.
